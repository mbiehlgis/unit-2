            <h3> A Brief History </h3>
            <p> After World War II, Japan's total population stood at about 72.5 million after an approximate 2.3 million Imperial
            Japanese military personnel were killed since the beginning of the invasion in 1931. Japan's female population between the ages of 20-40 vastly
            outnumbered its male counterparts, a clear reflection of the war's aftermath. As of 2019 however, its population increased
            to <strong>over 125 million</strong>, making Japan the 11th largest country in the world. <br></p>

            <h3> What Caused This Population Boom? </h3>
            <p> Ironically, the event that caused the single largest loss of human life is also the same event that caused the largest spike in populations for countries
            in the years following it. Millions of young men returning to Japan after years of fighting set the stage for the country's first post-war baby boom. The decade
            following would lead to the generation of a <strong>Total Fertility Rate of 4.54</strong>, more than double the necessary 2.1 for a country's population to grow.
            <br><br> A high TFR is a strong indicator for future economic growth due to the larger number of people available to increase a country's productivity. Evidence of this
            exists in Japan in the form of the plethora of renowned brands the world has become so familiar with such as Toyota, Sony, and Nintendo. This period in Japanese History
            is referred to as the <em>Post-War Economic Miracle</em>. Japan had successfully achieved an immense economy of both scale and scope for itself to thrive off of. By 1960, Japan
            had established itself as the world's 2nd largest economy next to the US.
            <br><br>
            </p>

            <h3> Signs of Decline </h3>
            <p> These economies of scale/scope do come with a price, which is that they must maintain a workforce size large enough to sustain itself. Unfortunately for
            Japan, in 1957 the country saw its TFR began to slowly decline. The ramifacations of this however are hard to foresee or prepare for in the moment since it takes
            generations for results to manifest. <br></br>

            In tandem with this is another issue that at first may sound like a net positive, which is the Japanese culture's hyper-focus on discipline
            and hard work. A clearly positive result of this strong work-drive is the quality of worker that Japanese schools output <em>on paper</em>, which are employees that expect
            long hours and little vacation time. The underlying problem with this however is that the culture was actively priming its young workers to neglect thoughts of anything that
            may intrude on work life, which includes the idea of starting a family.

            The pivotal moment that revealed the inherent flaw in Japan's culture occurred in the early 1990's as the Japanese stock market crashed, which just happened to occur
            around the same time as when China truly began opening itself up for foreign investment. From this point forward, China effectively replaced Japan as the world's premiere
            export-manufacturer, and the Japanese economy arguably has not recovered since.

            <h3> Contemporary Ramifications </h3>
            <p> Japan's population debacle came to a head in 2010 when it was revealed that for the first time since World War II, Japan's total population size decreased from its peak of about 128.5 million.
            When taking into account both Japan's rapidly aging population and it's already middling economy, government officials are now actively trying to develop methods to reignite, or
            at the very least sustain, its TFR. The failure to do so earlier has already illustrated itself via rapidly rising social security costs, meaning that a smaller population of Japan's
            youth are now responsible for sustaining the financial security for a larger and older generation. In other words, they will need to pay much higher taxes. As taxation increases in a country,
            civil distrust in their government typically rises in correlation, which can be a recipe for extreme ideas to appear normal. <br><br>
            The video below explains how one ideology appears to be on the rise in the country:

            <h3> Potential Solutions </h3>
            <p> When it comes to solving the issue of a falling birth rate, there are only 2 primary methods of solving or at least mitigating its effects:<br>
            <strong>1. Encourage Domestic Citizens to Start Families</strong> <br> The first is to simply try to actively encourage
            the population to reproduce. Japan has attempted in doing so by expanding family and child-care policies such as requiring certain companies to offer daycare services in an attempt to create a
            lessen the financial risks of starting a family. Another method they've implemented is a program to allow parents to have 12 months of leave if they meet certain work requirements. <br>
            <strong>2. Ease Immigration Policies</strong> <br> The second method of reigniting a country's TFR is to simply <em>import</em> new youth members. Allowing citizens from countries with higher
            birth rates to work and live within domestic borders can help provide a temporary boost to the TFR. The inherent risk to this method however is the domestic population's apprehensive feelings about
            losing their sense of importance as well as losing what <em>defines</em> their nationality and culture. In Japan's case, they have historically had a strong resistance to mass migration, and in some cases
            a resistance based in <strong>xenophobia</strong>. The Japanese government has however increased their allowance of foreign workers and migration in recent years, despite the worry of some members of the public.
            </p>

            <h3> In Review </h3>
            <p> Ultimately, Japan is facing a potential wave of problems if they don't resolve this issue soon. It should also be something all contemporary 1st world nations should be using as a case study, since their birth
            rates are projected to diminish as well. If these economies all begin to stumble due to an old populace, the world may experience a complete overhaul in its power-structure.
